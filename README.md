# Project Detail
# Introduction:
We have made a computer shop database program on C++, this program consists of six functions keyboards, Monitors, Rams, Graphics_Card, Processors and m_boards. These functions are further divided into different models for example Keyboard is divide into 3 models, Asus gaming keyboard, Mechanical keyboard, and Non branded keyboards. Users have different choices, when the users select an object and a model of that object, price of that model will be displayed on the screen. After that, a message will be displayed on the screen that “do you want to but more “name of that function”(y or n):” if the user presses “y” , models will displayed on the screen again and if user presses “n” then again another message will be displayed on the screen that “If you want to but more press ‘y’ else press ‘n’:” if the user presses ‘y’ then functions list will displayed on the screen again and if user presses ‘n’ then program will exit.
# Objectives: Our program will provide authentic information and prices of the objects and users can buy multiple things using our program. we have use different techniques which will help the user to understand the output and select the right object and model of that object.
# Features used:  We have used different loops, decision structures, Functions, and go-to statement in our program. For example, we have used if else statement for the different models of keyboards and for model quantity price we have used   while loop. Similarly, we have used if else with motherboard, processor, and graphics card and for their model’s price quantity we have used while loop. In rams and monitor function we have used switch statement, for ram model quantity price we have used FOR loop. For monitor model’s quantity price, we have used while loop. We have used go-to statement in every function so that users can buy multiple things similarly we have also used go-to in main function if user wants to buy more.
